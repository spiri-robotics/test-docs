# Contributing to Spiri Documentation Test Build

This manual is written in plain text files that live in Git. You do not need to
be a programmer to edit it, and you do not need to install Python, Sphinx, or
anything else by hand — the setup below installs a self-contained environment
that has all of it already.

---

## Setting up

You need two free programs: **VS Code** (the editor) and **Docker Desktop**
(which runs the document toolchain in the background so you never have to
install or configure it yourself). This is a one-time setup of maybe twenty
minutes, mostly waiting for downloads. Afterwards it works offline.

### Windows

1. Install **Docker Desktop**:
   <https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/> — choose the Windows
   installer. When it asks, leave **"Use WSL 2 instead of Hyper-V"** ticked.
2. Restart when it asks you to. On first launch Docker may install a Windows
   component called WSL 2 and ask you to restart again — let it.
3. Install **VS Code**: <https://code.visualstudio.com/>
4. Open VS Code, and install the **Dev Containers** extension: click the
   Extensions icon in the left bar (four squares), search `Dev Containers`,
   click **Install** on the one published by Microsoft.

### macOS

1. Install **Docker Desktop**:
   <https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/> — pick **Apple Silicon** if
   your Mac is an M1/M2/M3/M4, or **Intel** for anything older. If you are not
   sure: Apple menu → About This Mac, and look at "Chip" or "Processor".
2. Open Docker Desktop once from Applications and leave it running. It needs to
   be running whenever you work on the manual — you will see a whale icon in the
   menu bar.
3. Install **VS Code**: <https://code.visualstudio.com/>
4. Open VS Code, and install the **Dev Containers** extension: click the
   Extensions icon in the left bar (four squares), search `Dev Containers`,
   click **Install** on the one published by Microsoft.

### Then, on either platform

1. Get a copy of this repository. In VS Code, press `Ctrl+Shift+P`
   (`Cmd+Shift+P` on a Mac), type `Git: Clone`, press Enter, and paste the
   repository URL. Choose a folder to keep it in.
2. When VS Code asks **"Open the cloned repository?"**, click **Open**.
3. VS Code will notice this project has a container and show
   **"Reopen in Container"** in the bottom-right. Click it.

   Missed the prompt? Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P` and run
   **Dev Containers: Reopen in Container**.

4. The first build takes a few minutes — it is downloading the toolchain. After
   that it is a few seconds. You will know it has finished when the terminal at
   the bottom says `Ready.`

## Writing

The manual is the `.md` files in the [`docs/`](docs/) folder. They are
**Markdown**: ordinary text with a few marks for structure.

```markdown
# A chapter heading

## A section heading

Ordinary paragraphs need no marks at all.

- a bullet
- another bullet

1. a numbered step
2. another step

**Bold text** and *italic text*.
```

### Seeing your changes

Press **`Ctrl+Shift+B`** (**`Cmd+Shift+B`** on a Mac). The manual builds and
opens in a panel beside your text, and it refreshes by itself every time you
stop typing for a moment. Leave it running while you work.

### Safety notices

Use these for anything a reader could be hurt by. Type them exactly like this:

````markdown
:::{danger}
Will cause death or serious injury if not avoided.
:::

:::{warning}
Could cause death or serious injury if not avoided.
:::

:::{caution}
May damage the aircraft or equipment.
:::

:::{note}
Useful information, not a hazard.
:::
````

### Checking your writing

**Terminal → Run Task → Check writing style** runs the house style guide over
the manual and lists anything it would like changed. It is advisory: suggestions
are worth reading, but nothing is blocked if you disagree with one.

### Silencing the style checker

Sometimes the checker is wrong — a part number reads as a misspelling, or a
sentence has to be passive because the aircraft is what matters, not who acted.
You can switch it off for a passage with two comments:

```markdown
<!-- vale off -->
Torque to 4.5 N·m as specified by the airframe manufacturer.
<!-- vale on -->
```

Everything between the two is left alone. **Do not forget the `vale on`** — if
you leave it out, the rest of the file goes unchecked and nobody will notice.

Better, when you know which suggestion you are dismissing, is to switch off only
that one. The rule name is the last thing on each line of the checker's output —
`Microsoft.Passive` in this example:

```markdown
<!-- vale Microsoft.Passive = NO -->
Torque to 4.5 N·m as specified by the airframe manufacturer.
<!-- vale Microsoft.Passive = YES -->
```

Everything else stays checked, so a genuine typo in that passage is still
caught.

You do not have to type either of these. Select the sentence, press
`Ctrl+Shift+R` (`Cmd+Shift+R` on a Mac), and pick one of:

- **Silence the style checker here** — wraps your selection in the off/on pair,
  so the `vale on` cannot be forgotten.
- **Silence one style rule here** — the same, for a single rule. It fills in a
  placeholder rule name and selects it in both comments at once, so typing the
  real one over it corrects both.

These comments do not appear in the built manual — not on the website and not in
the PDF. They work anywhere in a page, including inside a `:::{warning}` block
and inside a list. There is no way to silence one line from within that line;
the comments go on the lines around it.

A word of restraint: the checker is advisory, so an unwanted suggestion costs
you nothing but the reading of it. Silencing is for the case where the same
false alarm keeps interrupting the same passage. If you find yourself silencing
the same rule all over the manual, the rule is a poor fit for the kind of
document this is — say so to the document owner rather than papering over it,
because that is a fix everyone benefits from.

A proper noun the checker does not know — a product name, a supplier, a place —
is not a case for silencing at all. Add it to
[`styles/config/vocabularies/Spiri/accept.txt`](styles/config/vocabularies/Spiri/accept.txt),
one per line, and it is accepted everywhere in the manual.

### Checking the manual is sound

**Terminal → Run Task → Check the manual for problems** builds it once and
reports broken cross-references and anything else that would fail on the
website. Worth doing before you share your changes.

### Updating the tooling

**Terminal → Run Task → Update the tooling** pulls the latest build setup from
the template. It may ask you questions in the terminal — a newer template
sometimes has options the one you started from did not; the answers you gave
last time are offered as defaults, so pressing Enter through them is fine.

It touches only the build setup, never your prose, but look over the changes in
the Source Control panel before committing them.

## Adding a picture

Put the image file in `docs/_static/`, then refer to it:

```markdown
![A description of the picture for someone who cannot see it](_static/my-picture.png)
```

The description is not optional — it is what a screen reader says aloud, and
what appears if the image fails to load.

---

## Sharing your changes

You do not need to use Git on the command line. In VS Code:

1. Click the **Source Control** icon in the left bar (a branching line). Your
   edited files are listed.
2. Type a short message saying what you changed — "Corrected torque values in
   maintenance chapter" — in the box at the top.
3. Click **Commit**, then **Sync Changes**.

If you have been asked to work on a branch rather than directly on `main`, click
the branch name in the bottom-left corner first and choose
**Create new branch**.

## Revisions

`revisions.yaml` in the top folder records every issued version of this manual.
It is the *only* place a revision number is written — it fills in the cover
page, the page footers, and the name of the PDF automatically.

While a revision is being written it is marked `draft: true`, and the manual
says so on its cover and in its footer so a printed copy cannot be mistaken for
a finished one.

**Issuing a revision is a deliberate act** — check with the document owner
before removing `draft: true` or adding a new entry.

This is a regulator-facing document, so every issued revision must name an
approver and an effective date. The manual will refuse to build without them,
and will not accept `TODO` as an answer.

---

## If something goes wrong

**"Reopen in Container" does nothing, or errors.**
Check Docker Desktop is actually running — look for the whale icon in your menu
bar (macOS) or system tray (Windows). Start it, wait for it to say it is
running, then try again.

**The preview panel is blank or stuck.**
Close the panel, then press `Ctrl+Shift+B` / `Cmd+Shift+B` again.

**Everything is broken and I do not know why.**
Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P` and run **Dev Containers: Rebuild
Container**. This throws away the environment and builds a fresh one; it cannot
lose your written work, which is saved in the files themselves.

**Still stuck.** Open an issue on the repository, or ask the document owner.
Nothing here is your fault — if a step above was unclear, that is worth fixing,
so please say which one.
