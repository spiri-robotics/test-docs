"""Sphinx configuration for Spiri Documentation Test Build.

Theme and structure live here, because they are decided once per document.
Anything that has to be true on *every* build -- the revision number, the PDF
footer, validation of revisions.yaml -- lives in the spiri_docs extension
instead, where it cannot drift out of sync across manuals.
