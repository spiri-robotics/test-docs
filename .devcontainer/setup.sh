  Setup did not finish.

  This is usually a network problem on the first run. Try:

    Ctrl+Shift+P (Cmd+Shift+P on a Mac)
      -> "Dev Containers: Rebuild Container"

  If it fails again, copy the output above into an issue on the
  repository, or send it to the document owner. It is not something
  you have done wrong.
